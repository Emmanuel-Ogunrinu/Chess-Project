# Custom Chess Game Rules

Welcome to my custom chess game! This game combines the traditional chessboard layout and pieces with a unique set of rules designed to provide both a challenging and refreshing take on the classic game. Understanding the rules may seem daunting at first, but once you grasp the basics, you'll find the gameplay intuitive and engaging.

## Game Board and Setup

The chessboard consists of eight rows and eight columns, totaling 64 squares of alternating colors. Each square on the board is uniquely identified by a coordinate system ranging from 0 to 7, both horizontally and vertically. This coordinate system is used to make moves within the game.

## Pieces and Movement

Each player controls a set of pieces, differentiated by case: capital letters represent black pieces, while lowercase letters denote white pieces. The types and quantities of pieces are as follows:

- **King** (K/k): 1 per side. Moves one square in any direction (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
- **Queen** (Q/q): 1 per side. Moves any number of squares in any direction.
- **Rooks** (R/r): 2 per side. Move any number of squares vertically or horizontally.
- **Bishops** (B/b): 2 per side. Move any number of squares diagonally.
- **Knights** (N/n): 2 per side. Move in an "L" shape: two squares in one direction and then one square perpendicular to that.
- **Pawns** (P/p): 8 per side. Move forward one or two squares from their initial position, depending on the situation.

## How to Play

To make a move, enter the coordinates of the piece you wish to move followed by the coordinates of the destination square. For example, to move a piece from the square at vertical array 2 and horizontal array 4 to the square at vertical array 3 and horizontal array 4, you would input those coordinates in the specified order. If the move is valid, the piece will move to the desired location.

## Winning the Game

The primary objective is to checkmate the opponent's king, which means the king is in a position to be captured and cannot escape capture. Unlike traditional chess, our custom version does not include a stalemate rule; therefore, the game only ends when one player's king is checkmated.

## Rule Changes

Please note that the rules outlined here are subject to change. As players discover new strategies and potential loopholes, adjustments may be made to ensure fair and competitive gameplay.

## Conclusion

We hope you enjoy this unique twist on the classic game of chess. Whether you're a seasoned chess player looking for a new challenge or a newcomer eager to learn, this game offers something for everyone. Happy gaming!
